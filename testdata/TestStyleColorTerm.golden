[34mAVAILABLE STYLES[0m
    
    Section [4mIntroduction[24m already demonstrates useful styles 
    Styles, this section completes with most of the others 
    possibilities.
    
    Notably, package '[4mstyle[24m' can print in [31mred[0m or [1m[32mbold green[0m[22m.
    
    It also knows how to format [3mlists[23m:
    
    - this very long and detailed sentence is here to 
    demonstrate that list can be formatted and wrapped 
    because it hopefully be so long that it will not fulfill
    the maximum number of authorized char per lines is 
    reached.
    
    - It is also possible to check that paragraph inside 
    lists are respected.
    As you can see here in this simple example.
    
    It also knows how to [3mdefine[23m terms:
    
    [1mstyle[22m:
        A particular procedure by which something is done; a
        manner or way.
