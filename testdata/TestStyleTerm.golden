INTRODUCTION

This small piece of text aims at demonstrating and testing 
my styling package 'style'.

It is writen by a non-native English speaker, so pardon any 
faults.

EXAMPLES OF AVAILABLE STYLES

Section Introduction already demonstrates useful styles from
package 'styles', this section completes them with most of 
the others possibilities.

Notably, package 'style' can print in red or bold green (if 
schosen style supports it).

It also knows how to format lists:
    - This very long and detailed sentence is here to 
    demonstrate that list can be formatted and wrapped. It 
    should hopefully be so long that it will not fulfill the
    maximum number of authorized char per lines is reached.
    - It is also possible to check that line inside lists 
    are respected.
    As you can see here in this simple example.

It also knows how to define terms:
    
    style:
        A particular procedure by which something is done; a
        manner or way.

DEMONSTRATING TABLES

Package 'style' supports drawing tables for most basic 
cases. Using Tab to align tables should be done carefully as
table way to guess optimum columns size does not take into 
account the tabulation

Column1      Column2                 Column3                
------------ ----------------------- -----------------------
Basic column This one is here        Last but not least     
             to demonstrate          shows formating within 
             that colums with        the table              
             several lines work too
