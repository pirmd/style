# INTRODUCTION

This small piece of text aims at demonstrating and testing 
my styling package 'style'.

It is writen by a **non-native** English speaker, so pardon 
any faults.

# EXAMPLES OF AVAILABLE STYLES

Section Introduction already demonstrates useful styles from
package 'styles', this section completes them with most of 
the others possibilities.

Notably, package 'style' can print in red or **bold green** 
(if chosen style supports it).

It also knows how to format *lists*:
  - This very long and detailed sentence is here to 
    demonstrate that list can be formatted and wrapped. It 
    should hopefully be so long that it will not fulfill the
    maximum number of authorized char per lines is reached.
  - It is also a nice-to have feature that sub-lists are 
    supported
      . Sub-list is here
      . Sub-list is also here
  - It is also possible to have a list item containing 
    several paragraphs
    
    For example, this paragraph

It also knows how to *define* terms:

style:
    A particular procedure by which something is done; a 
    manner or way.

# DEMONSTRATING TABLES

Package 'style' supports drawing tables for most basic 
cases. Using Tab to align tables should be done carefully as
table way to guess optimum columns size does not take into 
account the tabulation

------------ ----------------------- -----------------------
Column1      Column2                 Column3                
------------ ----------------------- -----------------------
Basic column This one is here        Last but not least     
             to demonstrate          shows **formating**    
             that colums with        within the table       
             several lines work too                         
                                                            
             This second row is here Also possibly a good   
             to test multi-lines     opportunity to check   
             rows format             escaping *sequence*
