[34mINTRODUCTION[0m

This small piece of text aims at demonstrating and testing 
my styling package '[4mstyle[24m'.

It is writen by a [1mnon-native[22m English speaker, so pardon any 
faults.

[34mEXAMPLES OF AVAILABLE STYLES[0m

Section [4mIntroduction[24m already demonstrates useful styles from
package 'styles', this section completes them with most of 
the others possibilities.

Notably, package '[4mstyle[24m' can print in [31mred[0m or [1m[32mbold green[0m[22m (if 
chosen style supports it).

It also knows how to format [3mlists[23m:
  - This very long and detailed sentence is here to 
    demonstrate that list can be formatted and wrapped. It 
    should hopefully be so long that it will not fulfill the
    maximum number of authorized char per lines is reached.
  - It is also a nice-to have feature that sub-lists are 
    supported
      . Sub-list is here
      . Sub-list is also here
  - It is also possible to have a list item containing 
    several paragraphs
    
    For example, this paragraph

It also knows how to [3mdefine[23m terms:

[1mstyle[22m:
    A particular procedure by which something is done; a 
    manner or way.

[34mDEMONSTRATING TABLES[0m

Package 'style' supports drawing tables for most basic 
cases. Using Tab to align tables should be done carefully as
table way to guess optimum columns size does not take into 
account the tabulation

------------ --------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Column1      Column2                           Column3                          
------------ --------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Basic column This one is here                  Last but not least shows         
             to demonstrate                    [1mformating[22m within the table       
             that colums with several lines                                     
             work too                                                           
                                                                                
             This second row is here to test   Also possibly a good opportunity 
             multi-lines rows format           to check escaping *sequence*
