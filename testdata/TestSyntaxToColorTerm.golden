[34mINTRODUCTION[0m

This small piece of text aims at demonstrating and testing 
my styling package '[4mstyle[24m'.

It is writen by a [1mnon-native[22m English speaker, so pardon any 
faults.

[34mEXAMPLES OF AVAILABLE STYLES[0m

Section [4mIntroduction[24m already demonstrates useful styles from
package 'styles', this section completes them with most of 
the others possibilities.

Notably, package '[4mstyle[24m' can print in [31mred[0m or [1m[32mbold green[0m[22m (if 
schosen style supports it).

It also knows how to format [3mlists[23m:
    - This very long and detailed sentence is here to 
    demonstrate that list can be formatted and wrapped. It 
    should hopefully be so long that it will not fulfill the
    maximum number of authorized char per lines is reached.
    - It is also possible to check that line inside lists 
    are respected.
    As you can see here in this simple example.

It also knows how to [3mdefine[23m terms:
    
    [1mstyle[22m:
        A particular procedure by which something is done; a
        manner or way.

[34mDEMONSTRATING TABLES[0m

Package 'style' supports drawing tables for most basic 
cases. Using Tab to align tables should be done carefully as
table way to guess optimum columns size does not take into 
account the tabulation

Column1      Column2                 Column3                
------------ ----------------------- -----------------------
Basic column This one is here        Last but not least     
             to demonstrate          shows [1mformating[22m within 
             that colums with        the table              
             several lines work too
